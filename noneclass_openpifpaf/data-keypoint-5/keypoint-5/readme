=== Keypoint-5 dataset for 2D keypoints on furniture
======================================================

This dataset consists of images of five categories of furniture, and their 2D
keypoint coordinates. The categories are bed, chair, sofa, swivelchair, and
table.

For each category, its folder contains
- ./images: images of objects of the category
- ./[train|test].txt: our suggested train/test split of images 
- ./coords.mat: coordinates of keypoints in a mat file. It contains a single
  variable 'coords' of size 2 x K x P x N, where K is the number of keypoints of
  the object category, P is the number of people on Amazon Mechanical Turk who 
  labeled the image, and N is the number of images in the category. Note that P 
  may vary for each image. Coordinates are in the format of [column, row].
